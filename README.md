==========

Just a backup github repo of ongoing work on my personal site. It might be of
some interest as a guide. It's basically a project to teach myself newer
website technologies.

### Features

* Hugo-based build system.
* hermit theme with site-specific tweaks.
* simple rsync deployment.

### TODO

mobile theming works fine except for the case where tables break things.
