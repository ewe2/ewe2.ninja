==========

This version of the code on github is now archived and read-only. For new updates, please see
[the new repository on Codeberg ](https://codeberg.org/ewe2/ewe2.ninja)

Just a backup github repo of ongoing work on my personal site. It might be of
some interest as a guide. It's basically a project to teach myself newer
website technologies.

Caution: may use outdated or insecure technologies in the process of building,
however none of these are utilized actively as part of the output.

### Features

* Hugo-based build system.
* hermit theme with site-specific tweaks.
* simple rsync deployment.

### TODO

mobile theming works fine except for the case where tables break things.
