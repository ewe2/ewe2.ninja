==========

Just a backup github repo of ongoing work on my personal site. It might be of
some interest as a guide. It's basically a project to teach myself newer
website technologies.

### Features

* Built from a basic middleman template to include HAML, SASS, Compass
  elements. Optional suzy and bh helpers.
* Uses middleman-deploy to simplfy deployment and middleman-syntax for
  highlighting.

### TODO

Break current pages down into partials and figure out a sidebar menu for
stuff.php to get on with content.
