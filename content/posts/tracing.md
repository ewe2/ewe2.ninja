### Executive Summary

The failure of COVIDsafe was a federal misstep. State QR code tracing apps
have been far more successful, which is fortunate because lockdowns have had
to continue being a major line of defence until vaccinations can catch up.

### Introduction

A year after the COVIDsafe fiasco, Australians are still largely dealing with
Covid-19 variants via lockdown mechanisms and a vital tool in implementing
them is the QR code tracing app. For example, in the latest Delta lockdowns
involving the outbreaks at the MCG and AAMI Park, COVIDsafe was acknowledged
to be no use whatsoever by Victorian authorities, whereas its own QR tracing
app, Service Victoria, was instrumental in finding and analysing tiers of
contacts and narrowing down the original carriers.

### The Apps

Confusingly, much of the information about the tracing apps, for users and
retailers still reference the term COVIDsafe.

The major states and territories each have their own app:

* West Australia has [SafeWA](https://www.wa.gov.au/organisation/covid-communications/covid-19-coronavirus-safewa)
* South Australia has [COVID-SAfe  Check-in](https://www.sa.gov.au/mysagov/covid-safe-check-in)
* Queensland has [Check-in Qld](https://www.covid19.qld.gov.au/check-in-qld)
* Victoria has [Service  Victoria](https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/checking-in-qr-codes)
* New South Wales has [Service  NSW](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/transaction/check-covid-safe-business-service-nsw-app)
* Tasmania has [Check in TAS](https://www.coronavirus.tas.gov.au/check-in-tas)
* Northern Territory has [The Territory Check  In](https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/stay-safe/check-in-app)
* Australian Capital Territory has [Check In  CBR](https://www.covid19.act.gov.au/business-and-work/check-in-cbr)

But in reality most of these apps share the same codebase and that largely
derives from a QR contact tracing app used by ACT Health in conjunction with
NSW. It was developed by a Melbourne-based company Arden Street Labs.

### Security Issues

Apart from the silence on the codebase and whether the app is compromisable,
there is also the issue of who has access to the information that the app
collects. This has already resulted in specific legislation to prevent police
access to SafeWA although in Victoria at the time this was
resisted by the acting Police Minister, preferring to leave it to the courts.
