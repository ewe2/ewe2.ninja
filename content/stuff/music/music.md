### Bands

During my youth I was in a number of original bands and cover bands, as a
bassplayer, singer and songwriter.

#### 1984-1989 Thanks for the Fish

* Originated in Brisbane, Australia. Played many support gigs to great bands
  and I'm proudest of our record of benefit gigs for various causes. Moved to
  Melbourne in early 1988 but did not get much traction and eventually broke
  up. 80's indie punk/pop. Made several demo tapes and a single vinyl release.

#### 1989-1991 Colour Jungle

* Melbourne. Formed with some friends, we had the great fortune of enjoying
  the talent of the remarkable John Lee of the Dingos. General rock and roll.
  Released a cassette of various tunes.

#### 1991-1992 Caplights

* The Caplights were a Melbourne accoustic/electric band of a similar genre to
  the better-known Things of Stone and Wood. Toured extensively around
  Victoria and put out a CD release and promptly disbanded.

#### 1992 The Great Curve

* Formed as a pickup after-hours cover band for The Club in Collingwood, the
  Curve were a fearless blend of new wave and trashy pop revisionism. They
  have been known to reform for festive occasions and torment their surviving
  fans.

### Instruments and gear

Chiefly bass, also keyboards, guitar, electronic instruments.

#### Basses

* Robbie: 2021 Yamaha 735A 5-string active PJ bass with a dark coffee sunburst
  body and rosewood fingerboard. I decided I needed a more versatile 5er and a
  PJ that could do a bit more than the SB-2. The passive tone is just
  wonderful, particularly on the P side but with the pickup balancer middled,
  its a great J sound too. Active tone is especially good for slap but also
  very nice for when you want to play right back on the bridge. You get that
  trademark Yamaha growl, really takes me back to the 80's, he's dark and
  smooth just like the the bassplayer I named him for!

* Perky: 2012 G&L SB-2 Tribute with ghs pressurewounds. My very favourite
  instrument.  Although made in Indonesia, it has virtually the same
  components as the USA-made ones in a standard package. Mine is the white
  with a  black pickguard, occasionally G&L change these colours. Well,
  *formerly white*. Due to what I suspect is a failed polyurethane cap layer,
  Perky is slowly turning pink where regular contact is made on the body. It's
  a form of relicing which isn't so bad unless it starts to crack badly, and
  then I'll need to protect it.

* Boris: Boris is a 2019 Squier Classic Vibe 70's Jazz bass, black body with a
  maple neck and fingerboard. As received he has a very punky/trebly bias
  which can be tamed somewhat but that's just what I like about him. Very fun
  to play.

* Blacky: 2003 Black Washburn XB125 5-string active bass. DR Rainbow Neons.
  Great 5-string for the price, and DR's give it a lovely warmth. Also made in
  Indonesia and is also a fantastic budget bass. As you can see by now,
  Indonesian-made basses, particularly from the Cort factory, are really good
  value and there's no reason to turn your nose up at them. However Blacky is
  a little bit of a one-trick pony, great for reggae but difficult to brighten
  up sufficiently for anything else. He is also unfortunately very dependent
  on his active preamp, the passive mode is very weak, basically useless. But
  in the right context, he's great.

* Bluey: Red Metallic Riverhead Headless longscale. This odd bass is a
  Riverhead version of the classic Steinberger shape but in wood! This bass is
  very old and battered, having gigged a lot and is retired pending a miracle
  of reworking!

#### Guitars

* Shona: Epiphone SG G400-Pro. A classic  vintage tone, not like your brasher
  Gibson style, but a much more mid-60's sound. Really fast and easy to play,
  it's a great rhythm guitar and also has the Peter Green out of phase middle
  pickup position sound.

* Sparky: A 2005 Epiphone SG Junior with the 700T bridge pickup. This one is
  defintely brash! Needs a bit of work done on it but quite playable and fun
  just to make noise with.

* Surfy: 2017 G&L Tribute Fallout (currently NYXL strings). This is an amazing
  guitar. Somehow it has balance pickups between a neck P90 and a bridge
  humbucker that can be coil tapped and it's still balanced with the tap and
  there's no volume drop in any position (aside from the perceptual one when
  you lose bass). Can twang which gives it tones between a Tele and a Strat,
  it covers all that ground and is still original. Fantastic.

* Siobhan: 2015 G&L Tribute Ascari GT-90. I probably have the last one sold
  "as new" in Australia, the line was discontinued in 2017 amid the CITES
  debacle. Stunning looks and sound, it's the perfect reggae guitar or the
  perfect anything-you-want guitar! Built almost like an LP except wholly out
  of mahogany, it certainly has that strong midrangey neck feel.

* Joanna: 2018 Cort Gold OM 06 Acoustic. This is from Cort's Chinese factory,
  and it's the top of the line, yet I paid under $A1k for it, an all-solid
  mahogany guitar with a sitka spruce top. It's a ridiculously good guitar,
  warm, articulate, the most morish acoustic I've ever owned.

#### Drum Machines and Groove Boxen

* **Alesis SR-16 drum machine**: A drum machine from the early '90s that only
  ceased production in 2003! The reason is the excellent quantiser and the
  solid sequencing and MIDI output.  You can input effects and audio to spice
  up the admittedly unexciting kits, and it's got some good panning. The
  sequencer can be fooled to create different time signatures for different
  patterns which then can be alternated in song mode. It misses some onboard
  effects but stimulates creativity.

* **Maschine Mk3** I needed something better than the SR-16 and more hands-on
  than just softsynths so after a lot of questing I settled on Maschine and
  its ecosystem, mainly because its impossible to ignore Kontakt these days
  and I had to get it. I do want another drum machine thingy though. Maschine
  is great in its own way though, and when I can get all the synths talking to
  each other, the synergy between the modx and maschine will I hope be
  fruitful. Until then, its going to be my beatbox.

#### Synthesizers

* **Yamaha Modx88** Polyphonic digital 88-key synthesizer. This was a very big
  purchase. I decided to merge two aims, a polyphonic synthesiser with a piano
  and Yamaha obviously targeted someone like me with this synth. It's
  basically a cut-down Montage but still has a LOT of sound-design capability
  in there if you want to dig into it, but if not, it's very targeted towards
  live performance needs. For most people, the smaller keyboards will suffice
  but for someone who wants the better keyboard, you can't avoid the 88 to get
  the weighted keys, but there's no aftertouch. It's a fully complient MIDI
  controller which will be handy later to control other things. The learning
  curve has been quite steep and there's a lot of stuff I've not bothered with
  yet but it can be quite useful as a sketchpad for ideas and once you're up
  to speed you can get a lot done, particularly connected to a DAW.

* **Novation Bass Station II**: A monophonic analog synthesizer, it really ticks
  all the boxes for basic synthesis for me. I love the aftertouch on the
  full-size keys, and the filter setup is really intuitive. I do find the
  arpegiattor and sequencer to be the most odd part of the machine, it takes
  some getting used to. It's a fantastic little unit for lead lines and silly
  noises! I'm in the market for a polysynth to deal with pads and some effects
  and my synthesiser world would be complete.  The other really nice thing is
  that it's uncomplicated to use as a MIDI synth/controller under several
  OSes. I've not used it under Windows, but I've been able to successfully
  read/write patches to/from it in Linux and use Rosegarden without issues.
  It's quite loud, actually, I have to record carefully in Audacity.

#### Production Gear

* **Steinberg UR22 USB Audio Interface**: Great USB interface usable under Linux
  as well as windows/mac. The mono inputs can fool you with panning from
  stereo interfaces, but its clean DACs are amazing. Very useful in MIDI
  situations where you want to sync between a couple of machines which can't
  do so directly themselves, and important for outputting MIDI data to a DAW.

  At one time before the later 3.16.x series of Linux kernels,
`linux/sound/usb/quirks-table.h` had to be modified for the UR22 in a
similar way to that for the Boss GT-10B, but thankfully it's a standard part
of the kernel since then. Depending on your setup, if you use pulseaudio, you
will have to kill it to allow native programs like audacity access the ALSA
channels to get input. When I'm not recording with it, I use the UR22 as a
simple practice interface by looping a line in from the computer to one of the
inputs, and plugging an instrument and headphones in. Some music will suffer
from the mono input but it does well enough!

* **Behringer XR16 Air Mixer** This is my new mixer that I have just got and
  haven't yet fully integrated my studio into yet, I need a bunch of cables
  first! It's basically a box on the floor that you plug cables from your
  machines into and the interface is an app that connects either by
  wifi/ethernet and your output ideally is via USB although if you're doing
  live stuff of course you have LR main outputs too. The mixer is needed so
  that the non-electronic instruments I have, have an interface with enough
  inputs that can do stereo, like my bass DI interface and stereo pedals as
  well as things like mid-side recording, my H4n Pro, audio from the modx,
  bs2, SR-16,Maschine, etc. It should enable me to cut down the confusion for
  my DAW, where I have to literally unplug usbs so it doesn't have the modx
  fighting the mixer or the maschine or the bs2 for dominance (ie i can force
  the modex to just be an audio and standard midi device through the mixer and
  not through its own USB). Well, that's the plan. I have to also get a MIDI
  box to make this happen too!

* **AKG Perception 220 Condenser Microphone**: Best value Neumann-design based
   microphone. I don't know what the 2nd version/usb version are like, I have
   the XLR version. Perfect for vocals and simple accoustic instrument
   recordings.

* **Zoom H4N Pro** These nifty little things are so useful in so many
  contexts, everyone should have them. I could have held out for a 6, but I
  couldn't really justify it, it was overkill for me, the H4n Pro was updated
  to backport some of the better features of the 5, like the mid-side encoder
  and effects, and a bunch of improvements. I got one of the nice black ones,
  the quality of the recording is great, records my acoustic guitar very well.

* **Boss GT-10B Bass effects processor**: Although superseded by later models,
  this is an amazing deal if you like your Boss effects. There is a
  [utility][1] to be able to reprogram it from a PC.  Linux users have to get
  their hands dirty with a patch to the ALSA usb driver in quirks-table.h.
  This file is a moving target: in recent kernels the entries for the Boss GT
  models has been removed. The catch-all entry won't work because the usb
  interface has a couple of specific modes, but don't be frightened, it's not
  that difficult a patch:

  First find `linux/sound/usb/quirks-table.h` and make a backup file
first! Then open the original in an editor and search for the Roland section
either by name or by vendor id `0x0582`. The file is sorted in
ascending order by device id, so we want to put our patch after ids
`0x0cxx` and before ids `0x0exx`, which puts us inbetween
two Roland Edirol models currently. Search for the Edirol UA-25EX and work
back from there. Found it? Good. Fortunately the syntax for usb quirks hasn't
changed, particularly for Roland/Boss devices so this patch should work for a
number of kernels in the 3.x.x series. You'll have to apply it by hand, of
course, so select and paste the following code into a text file and copy that
just before the leading `{` of the UA-25X entry:

~~~ c


{
	/* BOSS GT-10B */
	/* FIXME: this driver is assumed to work like its guitar brother the
	 * GT-10, but there may be subtle differences which need debugging.
	 * Standard mode is 0x00dd, Advanced is 0x00dc
	 */
	USB_DEVICE(0x0582, 0x00dc),
	.driver_info = (unsigned long) & (const struct snd_usb_audio_quirk) {
		.vendor_name = "BOSS",
		.product_name = "GT-10B",
		.ifnum = QUIRK_ANY_INTERFACE,
		.type = QUIRK_COMPOSITE,
		.data = (const struct snd_usb_audio_quirk[]) {
			{
				.ifnum = 0,
				.type = QUIRK_AUDIO_STANDARD_INTERFACE
			},
			{
				.ifnum = 1,
				.type = QUIRK_AUDIO_STANDARD_INTERFACE
			},
			{
				.ifnum = 2,
				.type = QUIRK_MIDI_FIXED_ENDPOINT,
				.data = & (const struct snd_usb_midi_endpoint_info) {
					.out_cables = 0x0001,
					.in_cables = 0x0001
				}
			},
			{
				.ifnum = -1
			}
		}
	}
},

~~~

The reference to standard mode and advanced is because only the advanced mode
works for use with fxfloorboard. Recompile the module and you should be in
business. fxfloorboard is invaluable for making backups because noone can
remember all those settings for that awesome patch you made.

### Current work

I've been writing semi-instrumental electronic music for some years, some of it is on
[Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/penguinmusic) and I did a lot on tindeck
before that went down, that is now archived
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1rxk5i-I5P4le81P28c2XqSyNAJUzpku1).
Most of it is parody songs, some are originals, quality varies greatly!


See also my [penguinmusic.bandcamp.com](penguinmusic.bandcamp.com), for which
I hope to be writing more music in the coming year.


### General fandom stuff

The Beatles were my first great fandom which continues. I would probably count Talking Heads as my
next big interest but I was just as interested in Split Enz, the Police, the Cure, Eno, and a number
of other post-punk bands, so as a musician I was never wholly in the punk camp. By the late 80's I
became a full-blown Smiths/XTC/They Might Be Giants fiend and then everything changed in the 90's
and the list of Stuff To Like and People Who Get It grew ever-longer. Since the 2000's I've actually
had to go backwards in time to catch up with all the amazing changes in the electronic dance genres,
to the point where I am now which is not having any idea but just going with what sounds good!
