so we want to move to a jekyll build system that is automated by Rake.

- move files to be processed into a jekyll-friendly layout. make sure other
  build files know where to find things.
- japr needs stuff in an _assets folder and files that need preprocessing need
  renaming. it also needs a _plugins dir.

jekyll usually outputs to a _site/. We need to process what japr does to fit
our site layout which is

/
css/
js/
fonts/ ?

in addition our suffix is php because we use some php scripting.
