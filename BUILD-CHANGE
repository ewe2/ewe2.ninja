figuring out a build system that'll work. initally looked at jekyll but it has
issues, its slow and inflexible.

in addition our suffix is php because we use some php scripting.

the idea now is to use middleman to build with compass doing the css and haml
to template the common parts of the site. still need to use markdown for
actual text tho.
