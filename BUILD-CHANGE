so we want to move to a jekyll build system that is automated by Rake.

- move files to be processed into a jekyll-friendly layout. make sure other
  build files know where to find things.
- japr needs stuff in an _assets folder and files that need preprocessing need
  renaming. it also needs a _plugins dir.

jekyll usually outputs to a _site/. We need to process what japr does to fit
our site layout which is

/
css/
js/
fonts/ ?

in addition our suffix is php because we use some php scripting.

so now we have the jekyll layout, we will need to rewrite stuff in those dirs.
using an idea to intergrate compass but will probably need a rakefile so the
result gets put into _site/ .


Hmmmm. Hold it. Upon looking into jekyll its got some issues: not flexible
enough and very slow once you increase processing requirements (ie cant
scale). So we'll try out middlman instead!. This is __OK__. devel is just the
place to try out these things!.
