figuring out a build system that'll work. initally looked at jekyll but it has
issues, its slow and inflexible.

in addition our suffix is php because we use some php scripting.

the idea now is to use middleman to build with compass doing the css and haml
to template the common parts of the site. still need to use markdown for
actual text tho.

The basic build process is done, all source files have been hamel-ized, we
just need to break that down into layout templates so we can construct stuff
into a landing page with a templated menu and markdown content.

for future reference:

you dont need a separate sass dir, just put what you need into a css dir that
you'll serve, give that to the config.rb that middleman will pick up and the
compass stuff will be done inline and copy over existing css files.

html2haml does a great job of converting to haml so its just a matter of
seeing how to break stuff down.
