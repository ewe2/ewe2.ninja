sass mostly done, clean up compass method
implement grunt build

compass breakdown

do as much setting in config.rb to stop cluttering things up. either keep
compass watch running in another terminal (in devel branch!) or just run it
after editing. try running compass compile --production in master branch.

the flow should be:
devel for work, then merge to master.
when master done merge COMPLETED FILES ONLY to release!

this means we have to checkout just css/ and any changed php files at this
stage. do NOT git rm in the working directory from now on!

howto: 
git co master <files>

fix whatever conflicts then do a release commit and tag with r numbers (devel
is v numbers).
