sass mostly done, clean up compass method
implement grunt build

the flow should be:
devel for work, then merge to master.
when master done merge COMPLETED FILES ONLY to release!

this means we have to checkout just css/ and any changed php files at this
stage. do NOT git rm in the working directory from now on!

howto: 
git co master <files>

fix whatever conflicts then do a release commit and tag with r numbers (devel
is v numbers).
