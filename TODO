image shortcodes.

have an imgproc shortcode for managing images for now but I'm very unhappy with it for several reasons and I want to replace it:

- FIXED the alt-tag issue by removing the dumb code at the bottom and adding an extra parameter and code to display it.

- What I hadn't appreciated before is where Hugos default page bundle struturing was forcing its globbing to go. When you look at the processing you see that posts/postname/index.html determines that the images MUST go under that slug to be globbed in that hierarchy.

In a similar way, whatever taxonomy you decide upon, you're stuck with the resultant slug hierarchy. For me that means stuff/area/topic/index.html also requires directories to be explicitly made for images to be put there. There is a default way of doing this by getting hugo to create them with "hugo new" now, which is done from the base directory of the site.

Any other images will need to be in the static area and referenced directly via the base structured html, the way this theme works. It's probably for the best, now that I understand. However it would still be worth doing some optional processing for image stuff in line with the changes to baseof.html that could/should be done so all that code and mermaid's could be bundled all together and then all image and css assets are sure to be relative to the hierarchy and processed according to the way hugo operates.

- Actual Site notes
  need to rewrite https://ewe2.ninja/stuff/computers/ching/#vax-ching-unix32v-1979 to https://ewe2.ninja/stuff/computers/ching/#bsd-ching-1979-1990-to properly tell the story of Ultrix-11 or V7M. It is the development of unix immediately after 32v that took the V7 ching binaries onto Vax as part of assembling a new disbribution that included BSD sources with the AT&T originals.
