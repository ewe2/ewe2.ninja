      <h2 class='cover-heading'>Tolkien Criticism</h2>
      <h3 id="the-literary-problem">The Literary Problem</h3>
      
      <p>There are Those Who Know Better. Other commentators (particularly [Shippey]<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
      for his description of their reactions to the book polls) have already noted
      the curious hatred the literati have for Tolkien. It amounts to a dismissal of
      Tolkien as amateurish and Tolkien fans as childish. This reaction was already
      in force in Tolkien's day, but that it persists in a void of serious
      examination and investigation is amazing compared to the massive work still
      done on Eliot, Joyce and other giants of the 20th century. Tolkien appears to
      be such an exception to the rules by which modern criticism lives that it's
      altogether unapproachable. Does that mean it's too difficult?</p>
      
      <p>It must also be said from the outset that Tolkien had a long and stormy
      relationship with literary critics over myth itself. He refused to discount
      folk tales as insignificant or merely repetitive, but sought to understand the
      cultural relationships behind them, especially in their choice of words. He
      was also antagonistic to their methodology, regarding it as cleverness for its
      own sake, or for power, to which he seemed very sensitive. Witness this
      particularly revealing passage in LotR between Gandalf and Saruman:</p>
      <blockquote>
      "White!" he sneered. "It serves as a beginning. White cloth may be dyed. The
      white page can be overwritten; and the white light can be broken."
      "In which case it is no longer white," said I. "And he that breaks a thing to
      find out what it is has left the path of wisdom."
      </blockquote>
      
      <h3 id="shippeygate">ShippeyGate</h3>
      
      <p>What Shippey's book has achieved is a new nadir in Tolkien criticism: in
      conjunction with the movie releases, a new generation of establishment
      apologists have rushed to dismiss such a pro-Tolkien stance. The Shippey
      reviews in themselves should worry more careful critics. But they went further
      and tried to link their position as cultural guardians by using the movies as
      the logical extension to the "obvious" conclusions they draw about mainstream
      literary culture.</p>
      
      <p>A point that Shippey makes in his book, which cannot fail to be noticed, is
      that critics misrepresent LotR according to their own prejudices (Shippey is
      guilty of Anglocentrism when he ascribes this chiefly to class-distinctions).
      He might also have noted this is true even of the sympathetic ones. What is
      one to make of the insinuations by Andrew O'Hehir's [OHehir]<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> otherwise
      Shippey-like analysis of a "Tolkienian Fascism", with supposedly revealing
      remarks suggesting Tolkien wasn't entirely anti-Nazi? It's certainly a biased
      and out-of-context reading of the letters, in which Tolkien speaks as an
      onlooker with a philological interest (cf. the "Germanic ideal"), and as
      someone uncomfortably familiar with the games of power, and suspicious of the
      simplistic good vs. evil propaganda of WWII. Indeed, to paraphrase the words
      of LotR <em>…the victor has emerged, stronger than either, and free of doubt.</em>
      O'Hehir oddly changes tack and excuses Tolkien later on the grounds that he
      disliked the <em>rational forms of government.</em> What Tolkien was actually saying
      about feudalism is that there was actually a bond of moral obligation between
      villein and lord that no longer exists in the rational forms, a bond that
      existed as far as the British officer-batman relationship in WWI, and a bond
      described by Frodo and Samwise's friendship. That we still actually understand
      this relationship is to be wondered at, since the idea has been culturally
      dead for a century.</p>
      
      <p>What makes O'Hehir's analysis (which has its good points) even odder is that
      it is a review of Shippey's book, not Tolkien's. Rather than examine Shippey's
      claim that Tolkien's work is in line with other important former combatant
      novelists (Orwell, Golding and Vonnegut) in that it tries to find a new
      language for describing evil, he practically dismisses them all in the
      time-honoured literati style of dubbing them <em>Great Weird Boy Books</em>, in which
      the distinguishing characteristics are big, difficult, and mix realism and
      fantasy. This conveniently ignores the point Shippey made that none of these
      authors were concerned with "realism" or "fantasy" as defined by the literati,
      or at all concerned with their <em>difficulty.</em> Shippey has no illusions about his
      qualifications as a critic, but he is at least giving a useful critical
      perspective. It is revealing, as Shippey notes, that many of Tolkien's
      contemporaries are read as school texts, but he is not. Perhaps because they
      can be "explained away" better than Tolkien.</p>
      
      <p>Julith Shulevitz [Shulevitz]<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> takes the movies as a starting-point to slag
      Tolkien off in a variety of self-contradictory ways: as a come-uppance for the
      <em>tweedy philogist</em> (surely calling the kettle black here), and most
      conspicuously, lumping him together with J.K Rowling as a children's writer.
      Admitting she loved the books as a child, she still sees them in categorical
      terms: like Rowling, Tolkien wasn't writing for a demographic, but
      contemporary criticism like Shulevitz's depends on it, so <em>obviously</em> LoTR is
      the progenitor of all modern fantasy - perhaps not so far from the truth -
      which is, of course, a Bad Thing.</p>
      
      <p>Now it gets odd. A literary geek gets into the act, but Julian Dibble
      [Dibble]<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> in his eagerness to prove anti-Shulevitz and pro-geek, gets
      horribly confused and ends up echoing her very arguments: starting on the
      premise that Tolkien has always been important to geek culture, which is
      reasonable, he literally drew a line and began to dismiss Tolkien on literary
      grounds: <em>..Tolkien's theory of evil? Well, orcs are, our heroes aren't, and
      that about sums it up.</em> He then goes on to characterize Tolkien as a sort of SF
      mind-expander that explores <em>..reality's stretchiest edges Like computer games.</em>
      He really wrote that.</p>
      
      <p>And speaking of weird, I only recently came across Jenny Turner's [Turner]<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>
      analysis in the web version of her Times Literary Supplement article Reasons
      for Liking Tolkien. If that sounds suspiciously like an excuse, you're
      correct. Turner is another critic who has weaned herself off the evil Tolkien
      drug, but rather than write from her own perspective, she regurgitates O'Hehir
      and Shippey to attempt an absolution from lit.crit. hell. Her essay has
      obsequious lit .crit written all over it, which she derides in Shippey and
      general Tolkien criticism, most ironically when she is doing her best to
      distance her perspective from lit. crit. itself! To quote: <em>Obviously there is
      a problem with the elves and so on. Obviously there is a problem with the
      prose. Obviously there are problems to do with women, and race and racism, and
      the general matchstick-cathedral labour-of-madness nature of the project. But
      if it's really that bad, why do so very many people like it so enormously?
      That word obviously crops up a lot. Even Magic Realism gets a look-in. But
      here is the unpalatable truth: Even now, even as I find the book silly and
      boring and rather noisome (to use a word from J.R.R.'s special vocabulary), it
      still locks with my psyche in a most alarming way.</em> </p>
      
      <p>Strangely, she doesn't account for this in any intelligible way. She instead
      looks for psycho-social explanations (the classic post-modernist
      pseudo-analysis): Tolkien secretly believed in elves! Sex is necessary for
      reality! But the classic statement is actually in a footnote, explaining her
      dislike for Rowling's Harry Potter books. She didn't like the description of
      Dumbledore as a 'supreme mugwump', calling it 'uneuphonious', sounding like
      'muggles', being an Algonquin word (from which the word's usage in English is
      actually derived, but I'm certain she's ignorant of that), and for being in
      Burrough's Naked Lunch. To which the disinterested bystander will say So
      what?, and go back to reading Tolkien and Rowling for the very good reason
      that they prefer brownies, not brownie-points.</p>
      
      <p>I sense a position here: any popular book that doesn't play with reality in
      the manner prescribed by modern critical law must therefore be obscurist or
      childish or both. It follows that no serious critical value can be obtained
      and is a trap for the novice analyst. There's one question I would like
      cleared up: why do literary critics think in terms of Freud and not Jung when
      they analyse Tolkien? Can't they have courses in contemporary psychology like
      the rest of us?</p>
      
      <h3 id="the-geek-perspective">The Geek Perspective</h3>
      
      <p>A cynic might comment that literary worth is in inverse proportion to public
      acceptance, but what is being dismissed is possibly one of the major cultural
      influences of our time. The Geek = LotR fan equation proposed by some is not
      so far-fetched as you might think, given that so-called "geeks" are more than
      the one-dimensional gnomes of code that the media describe.</p>
      
      <p>I feel I may fairly comment, for I can be classed as geek (note that there is
      a holy war over whether geeks are a class of nerd or vice-versa and if that
      matters to you, then you're probably a nerd). I write programs, maintain
      web-sites and pretty much a net addict when I can get my fix, but I am also
      deeply interested in books and culture and have been a musician for decades.
      In short, I am a creative person, and appreciate creativity in many forms.
      Joyce and Tolkien may be worlds apart, but I can appreciate each on their own
      terms. To me, Joyce is a deconstructionalist, while Tolkien is interested in
      the power of myth. Why do the critics elevate one over the other? Because one
      is unreadable, and the other mythical? By the same token, Tolkien's
      examination of evil has no less force because it is grounded in myth, than
      Golding's examination because it is grounded in a "what if" scenario. Both
      have the pertinent point: evil is basic to mankind (and womankind, as O'Hehir
      should have said), whether you clothe it in realism or medievalism.</p>
      
      <p>For those who don't know the academic history, Tolkien was a philologist. That
      is, one who studies language on all fronts: linguistic, semantic,
      etymological, etc. It was philologists who reconstructed the dead language
      Gothic and provided much of the reconstruction of Anglo Saxon and Middle
      English, of which Tolkien was master. Philology didn't shy from using myth as
      an aid, and it was this aspect particularly that brought it down in the eyes
      of the establishment; it was then broken down into the above-mentioned
      categories, and by the 1950's, when LotR was published, it was regarded as a
      dead and discredited discipline. There are still many who regard themselves as
      philologists in response to increasingly obscure rationalisations of language,
      which they feel ignores its wider socio-historical context. All this may seem
      to be merely side issues, but when critics of Tolkien dismiss his books as
      "fake myth", one suspects it may be due in part from an anti-philological
      literary background. I have yet to see an intelligent appraisal of his
      invented languages by a critic; they seem only able to regard them as possibly
      racist trivia. This is a great mistake.</p>
      
      <p>Central to Tolkien's art is the belief that people react emotionally to the
      written and spoken word, either individually or within a specific style. This
      is a linguistic insight: that different peoples have preferences for different
      groups of sounds; Tolkien's books are carefully written to take advantage of
      that idea. Indeed Tolkien himself declared that the myths were written to
      support the languages, not the other way around. Modern critics have no
      problem associating others with this kind of craft, but don't equally apply it
      to Tolkien, yet Tolkien was by far the more knowledgeable about the roots of
      the English language and the way it evolved and demonstrated it particularly
      in LotR. In an age before the word processor, he rewrote and retyped LotR to
      hone the language for specific effects. What you get is something unique in
      English literature: the sense of how different races and cultures interact
      through a lingua fraca (the Common Speech), and the implications of that. I
      don't know that critics such as Shippey have really got this important point
      across. In an increasingly multi-cultural age, we have a novel that expresses
      that sense of interracial, inter-cultural exchange, and it was written 50
      years ago by an English professor!</p>
      
      <p>Of course, I am part of a culture that Tolkien himself would likely reject.
      Yet my culture loves words, is highly creative, and is surprisingly aware of
      its past. LotR is the book that launched a thousand fantasy authors, and is
      still the leading fantasy title. When book polls reveal massive public
      approval, it belies the notion that Tolkien enjoys only cult status. It's
      obviously not the cult status the critics desire; it appears to fail all their
      tests.</p>
      
      <h3 id="a-few-tests">A Few Tests</h3>
      
      <h4 id="sex">Sex</h4>
      
      <p>As an example of one such failed test, I'd like to address an issue about
      which most critics swing between outright dithering and wild fancy: sex in
      Tolkien novels. Apparently there's not enough of it, or it's weirdly
      sublimated. The idea that Sam's encounter with Shelob are a mythic
      representation of sex (O'Hehir again) is to me completely distasteful, and
      smacks of the worst Freudianism. Turner is one critic who opens up on their
      obsession - sex in books means adult themes (duh). If you have adult themes,
      you can't have fantasy apparently (Magic Realism is an exception, cough). This
      charge is repeated by [Jenkyns]<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>, who went so far as to declaim that Hobbits had
      apparently no balls (he says nothing about Sam's many children or perhaps he
      never go that far).</p>
      
      <p>So LOTR is again repressed, this time from a sneakier, less honest angle. The
      view that Tolkien is latently homosexual or homophobic, or somehow sexually
      immature I can only put down to the obsessive desire we have in this current
      culture to put sex at the centre of all motives. Tolkien himself put it this
      way: "…the story was like a terrible expedition to the North Pole", in other
      words, not at all concerned with the private lives of its characters but of
      the central journey. To do otherwise might satisfy the desires of critics, but
      would totally ruin the mythology Tolkien had been creating for over half a
      century. People also forget Tolkien's Catholicism which would also rather
      preclude such "digressions". But that's also a stylistic choice, not a tragic
      personality flaw that must be sought out and paraded to explain an irrational
      dislike. Again, none of this seems to bother Tolkien fans, so why are the
      critics obsessive about it? Why are they not looking for the real reasons for
      Tolkien's popularity?</p>
      
      <h4 id="myth">Myth</h4>
      
      <p>The excuse, "well if it's so much about myth, and myth has sex in it therefore
      it's broken" simply doesn't wash. This is lit. crits. other way of trying to
      get its cake and eat it; when cornered it declaims that it alone defines the
      argument. There is more to myth than sex or indeed religosity, and far more
      than the typical critics exposure to European myth, and this is a recurring
      theme in Tolkien criticism: the academic immaturity of its critics. Jenkyns is
      a good example of this: having ticked off his favourite comparisons, he goes
      on to "prove" that Tolkien fails them. He finds it impossible that Tolkien did
      not reference Wagner, or an explicit Catholicism, completely misunderstands
      Frodo's character development because it doesn't fit his preconceptions of the
      Hero, demonstrates his anaethema of medieval prose (virtually all lit. critics
      are), and you can read the rest of the list if you can be bothered finding it.</p>
      
      <p>An example of this blindness is racism. Once again forgetting that Tolkien's
      aims are oblivious to modernist/post-modernist mores, critics decry his
      portrayals of orcs as irredeemably racist, a <em>…northern European's paranoid
      caricature.</em>  This is missing the point so obviously that it makes plain their
      ignorance of European myth, and exposes their desire to have literature remade
      in their own image. Like Frodo, one might wish to have an invasion of orcs
      just to wake them up from their easy relativism and hypocritical political
      correctness. How is Zoroastrian dualism so rife in the Near Eastern origins of
      much of Western ethical/religious thought, uncomfortably dovetailing with
      Western logic, supposed to be inappropriate here? What Western myth is without
      it? Arguing that it seems simplistic is simplistic itself, an excuse to
      dislike the work without really examining it. Without any continuum, how does
      one distinguish the grey character from the black and white?</p>
      
      <p>Modern critics react with fear and loathing to such symbolism but the books
      were never written for them.</p>
      
      <h4 id="contemporaries">Contemporaries</h4>
      
      <p>One especially failed test is in the critical comparison of Tolkien with his
      contemporaries. Shippey noticed it particularly in relation to James Joyce
      They on the one hand, applaud Joyce for his use of Vico's medieval use of
      time, and abhor Tolkien for his medieval use of interlace plot is nonsensical.
      They serve the same purpose in different ways. And how different were his
      other contemporaries? Ezra Pound, in his Cantos, reeled off Venetian ledgers,
      Eliot wholesale plundered his favourite bits of Western poetry (particularly
      Dante, because he wrote in his own tongue and not Latin) throughout his entire
      career as a poet. Is it a coincidence that Pound and Eliot inaugurated the New
      Criticism, consigning Those Who Did Not Fit to God Knows Where? One big
      difference according to Shippey is that Tolkien actually fought a war, and
      Pound, Joyce and Eliot avoided it. Shippey goes on to make an interesting case
      for "war novelists" as a group trying to make sense of 20th century warfare
      through fantasy. This was immediately jumped-upon and discounted but I suspect
      if it had been some non-professors Honours paper it wouldn't have attracted
      such derision.</p>
      
      <h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
      
      <p>John Ralston Saul, in Voltaire's Bastards, makes the assertion that the critic
      is totally dominated by technique and obscurity for its own sake. What
      "important" writers are really read by the public, he asks. One has the
      feeling that most critics think that fantasy has been "done" and is no longer
      important. Yet the academic Tolkien himself who almost single-handedly brought
      to critical attention the importance of Beowulf as literature, a living
      document of the Anglo-Saxon world colliding head-on with Christianity. And
      LotR (in fact most of his work) is all about collisions: that between races,
      cultures, languages and ethos. But apparently this isn't obscure enough,
      interesting enough, or just plain too popular enough.</p>
      
      <p>There are lots of books to enjoy without requiring the permission of literary
      critics, and their function as guides to the underlying intentions of literary
      creativity seems to be trapped in a cul-de-sac as a result. Or perhaps there
      just isn't anything concrete to grasp underneath all that sexy realism, which
      is why readers flock to an author like Tolkien. How ironic to demand that
      Tolkien match up to a old anti-Semite fantasy opera-writer like Wagner, or
      regurgitate the same dot-points over and over. What a bore.</p>
