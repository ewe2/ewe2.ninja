### Bands

During my youth I was in a number of original bands and cover bands, as a
bassplayer, singer and songwriter.

1984-1989 Thanks for the Fish<br/>

* Originated in Brisbane, Australia. Played many support gigs to great bands
  and I'm proudest of our record of benefit gigs for various causes. Moved to
  Melbourne in early 1988 but did not get much traction and eventually broke
  up. 80's indie punk/pop. Made several demo tapes and a single vinyl release.

1989-1991 Colour Jungle<br/>

* Melbourne. Formed with some friends, we had the great fortune of enjoying
  the talent of the remarkable John Lee of the Dingos. General rock and roll.
  Released a cassette of various tunes.

1991-1992 Caplights<br/>

* The Caplights were a Melbourne accoustic/electric band of a similar genre to
  the better-known Things of Stone and Wood. Toured extensively around
  Victoria and put out a CD release and promptly disbanded.

1992 The Great Curve<br/>

* Formed as a pickup after-hours cover band for The Club in Collingwood, the
  Curve were a fearless blend of new wave and trashy pop revisionism. They
  have been known to reform for festive occasions and torment their surviving
  fans.

### Instruments

Chiefly bass, also keyboards, guitar.
