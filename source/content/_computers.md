### The wonderful world of bits

I didn't get interested in computing until the early 1990's when I bought my
first computer, a Packard Bell 486SX with a CD-ROM and a whle 4MB of RAM. I
very quickly tired of DOS and through early CD collections became aware of the
shareware and Unix legacies. Very soon I was running linux as well as dos and
had taught myself much about the hardware and software capabilities of my
computer. When I got on the internet myself eventually the journey
continued...

### Hardware stuff

I have a small collection of interesting computing devices. Currently:

* SGI O2 running Irix 6.5
* Commodore C64 with the marvellous IDE64 card
* SNES game console

Past devices include:

* Mac G3 server
* Mac G4 laptops
* iMac
* IBM eserver
* Alphaserver


### Computer History

I became interested in computer history as a means of understanding the many
layers of computer technology. When understood as an accretion of
technologies, computers become more interesting and fun to learn about!

Here are a collection of essays about various bits of Unix.
