### Things

Apart from the topics on the navigation to the left, I'm interested in many
things: 

* I've been an avid book reader since childhood, with a particular love
of history and science. To give you some idea, here's my goodreads list.

* My interest in politics has led to membership of the Greens. By
  participating I feel less helpless about the world.

* Not being a driver, I used to be a cyclist for many years, but these days I
  prefer just walking where I need to go when public transport isn't viable.
